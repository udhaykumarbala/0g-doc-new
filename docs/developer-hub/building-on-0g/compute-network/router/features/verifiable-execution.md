# Verifiable Execution

Every 0G Compute provider runs inside a **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** and cryptographically signs its responses. The Router can verify that signature synchronously on your behalf and report the result back in the response metadata.

## Opt in with `verify_tee`

Add `verify_tee: true` to any inference request, and the Router will verify the provider's TEE signature before returning the response. The verification result appears in the response trace.

<TabItem value="json" label="JSON body" default>

```bash
curl https://router-api.0g.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "zai-org/GLM-5-FP8",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    "verify_tee": true
  }'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="query" label="Query parameter">

For endpoints that use `multipart/form-data` (like `/v1/audio/transcriptions` or image edits), pass `verify_tee` as a query parameter instead:

```bash
curl "https://router-api.0g.ai/v1/audio/transcriptions?verify_tee=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@recording.mp3" \
  -F "model=openai/whisper-large-v3"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

`verify_tee` is a 0G Router extension — it's stripped from the request before being forwarded to the provider, so it doesn't interfere with the OpenAI-compatible schema.

## Reading the result

When `verify_tee` is set, the Router adds a `tee_verified` field to the response's `x_0g_trace` metadata block (which is present on every Router response — see [Response shape](./chat-completions#response-shape)):

```json
"x_0g_trace": {
  "request_id": "0852f405-6c56-40c2-a800-e6fd70785065",
  "provider": "0xd9966e13a6026Fcca4b13E7ff95c94DE268C471C",
  "billing": { "input_cost": "...", "output_cost": "...", "total_cost": "..." },
  "tee_verified": true
}
```

| `tee_verified` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `true` | The provider's TEE signature was validated successfully |
| `false` | A signature was present but did not verify — treat the response as untrusted |
| `null` / absent | Verification was not requested for this response |

## When to use it

- **Most chat-like applications** don't need per-request verification — the provider is already inside a TEE, and the network tolerates a small rate of signed-but-unverified responses.
- **Audit logs, high-trust pipelines, and research workloads** benefit from setting `verify_tee: true` so that every response carries a validated attestation flag alongside it.
- The pc.0g.ai UI enables `verify_tee` by default for playground requests; feel free to mirror that behaviour in your own clients.

## Trust model

`verify_tee: true` asks the **Router** to fetch the provider's TEE signature, look up the signer address on-chain, and verify the signature on your behalf. The Router returns a single boolean (`tee_verified`) summarising that check.

In other words, `tee_verified: true` in the response says *"the Router says it verified the signature."* It does **not** carry the raw signature back to you — you still have to trust the Router to have done the check honestly.

If that level of trust is acceptable for your application, stop here: set `verify_tee: true` and read the flag.

If you need an independent guarantee, **all the inputs the Router uses are public**, and you can reproduce the verification yourself. See the next section.

## Independent verification (advanced)

You don't have to trust the Router's `tee_verified` flag — the underlying inputs are all public, and the `@0gfoundation/0g-compute-ts-sdk` SDK ships a one-shot helper that does the whole verification for you.

### With the SDK (recommended)

The `chatID` required for verification comes from the **`ZG-Res-Key` response header** (the `id` field in the JSON body is a fallback when the header is absent). That means you need access to the raw HTTP response headers — `fetch` works directly; for OpenAI SDKs use their "raw response" / "with-response" helper.

```typescript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { createZGComputeNetworkBroker } from "@0gfoundation/0g-compute-ts-sdk";

// Any wallet works — processResponse only reads the chain and calls the provider's public signature endpoint.
const rpc = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("https://evmrpc.0g.ai");
const wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom().connect(rpc);
const broker = await createZGComputeNetworkBroker(wallet);

// 1. Make the request so you can read headers
const response = await fetch("https://router-api.0g.ai/v1/chat/completions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer sk-YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ model: "zai-org/GLM-5-FP8", messages: [...] }),
});
const data = await response.json();

// 2. Pull the two inputs processResponse needs
const providerAddress = data.x_0g_trace.provider;
const chatID          = response.headers.get("ZG-Res-Key") ?? data.id;

// 3. Verify independently — SDK reads the chain + calls the provider, not the Router
const isValid = await broker.inference.processResponse(providerAddress, chatID);
// true  → independently verified
// false → verification failed (treat response as untrusted)
// null  → provider has no verifiable TEE service (nothing to check)
```

Under the hood the SDK reads the provider's on-chain service record, fetches the signature from the provider, and verifies it against the TEE signer — the same work the Router does internally, but running on your side so you don't have to trust the Router's answer.

### Without the SDK

If you prefer to verify from scratch (e.g. from a language without the 0G SDK), the four steps you'd reproduce are:

1. Read the provider's service record from the on-chain `Service` contract using the `provider` address. The record gives you `url`, `teeSignerAddress`, and `verifiability`. (If `additionalInfo.targetSeparated` is true, use `additionalInfo.targetTeeAddress` as the signer instead.)
2. `GET {url}/v1/proxy/signature/{chatID}?model={model}` — returns `{text, signature}`.
3. Verify the signature as EIP-191 `personal_sign` against `teeSignerAddress`. Any standard Ethereum library works.
4. Confirm the signed `text` matches the response content you received from the Router.

All four steps pass → end-to-end cryptographic proof, no trust in the Router required.
