In the 0G network, storage nodes play a vital role in maintaining the system's decentralized storage layer. They are responsible for storing and serving data, ensuring data availability and reliability across the network. By running a storage node, you actively contribute to the network and earn rewards for your participation.
This guide details the process of running a storage node, including hardware specifications and interaction with on-chain contracts.

### Hardware Requirements

| Component | Storage Node | Storage KV |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Memory    | 32 GB RAM    | 32 GB RAM  |
| CPU       | 8 cores      | 8 cores    |
| Disk      | 500GB / 1TB SSD | Size matches the KV streams it maintains |
| Bandwidth | 100 Mbps (Download / Upload) | - |

:::note
- For Storage Node: The SSD ensures fast read/write operations, critical for efficient blob storage and retrieval.
- For Storage KV: The disk size requirement is flexible and should be adjusted based on the volume of KV streams you intend to maintain.

  <TabItem value="binary" label="Storage Node" default>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your storage node:

- Understand that 0G Storage interacts with on-chain contracts for blob root confirmation and PoRA mining.
- Choose your network: [Testnet](../developer-hub/testnet/testnet-overview.md) or [Mainnet](../developer-hub/mainnet/mainnet-overview.md)
- Check the respective network overview pages for deployed contract addresses and RPC endpoints.
- **For mainnet deployment**: Ensure you have real 0G tokens for transaction fees and mining rewards.


## Install Dependencies
Start by installing all the essential tools and libraries required to build the 0G storage node software.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
    ]}>
  <TabItem value="linux">

        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install clang cmake build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev protobuf-compiler
        ```
</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac">
        ```bash
        brew install llvm cmake
        ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
**Install `rustup`**: rustup is the Rust toolchain installer, necessary as the 0G node software is written in Rust.

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```   

 **Download the Source Code**: 

    ```bash
    git clone -b <latest_tag> https://github.com/0gfoundation/0g-storage-node.git
    ```

**Build the Source Code**

    ```bash
    cd 0g-storage-node

    # Build in release mode
    cargo build --release
    ```

This compiles the Rust code into an executable binary. The `--release` flag optimizes the build for performance.

## Setup and Configuration

Navigate to the run directory and configure your storage node for either testnet or mainnet.

:::info Config File References
The official configuration files are available in the [0G Storage Node GitHub repository](https://github.com/0gfoundation/0g-storage-node/tree/main/run):
- Testnet: `config-testnet-turbo.toml`
- Mainnet: `config-mainnet-turbo.toml`

Always use the latest versions from the repository as they contain the most up-to-date network parameters.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">

### Configuration

1. Copy the testnet configuration:

```bash
cd run
cp config-testnet-turbo.toml config.toml
```

2. Update the following fields in `config.toml`:

```toml
# Contract addresses for testnet
log_contract_address = "0x22E03a6A89B950F1c82ec5e74F8eCa321a105296" # Flow contract
mine_contract_address = "0x00A9E9604b0538e06b268Fb297Df333337f9593b" # Mine contract

# Testnet RPC endpoint
blockchain_rpc_endpoint = "https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai"

# Start sync block number for testnet
log_sync_start_block_number = 326165

# Your private key for mining (64 chars, no '0x' prefix)
miner_key = "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

3. Optional: Configure network settings if needed:

```toml
# Target number of connected peers (can be increased for better connectivity)
network_target_peers = 50
```

### Sharding Configuration

Sharding allows you to control how much data your storage node stores. This is particularly useful when disk space is limited.

#### Understanding Shard Position

The `shard_position` parameter determines which portion of the total network data your node stores:

```toml
# Format: shard_id/shard_number where shard_number is 2^n
# This only applies if there is no stored shard config in db
shard_position = "0/2"
```

**Format**: `<shard_id>/<shard_number>`
- `shard_id`: Which shard this node stores (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- `shard_number`: Total number of shards (must be a power of 2: 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.)

**Examples**:
- `shard_position = "0/2"` → Store 50% of data (shard 0 of 2 total shards)
- `shard_position = "1/2"` → Store 50% of data (shard 1 of 2 total shards)
- `shard_position = "0/4"` → Store 25% of data (shard 0 of 4 total shards)
- `shard_position = "2/4"` → Store 25% of data (shard 2 of 4 total shards)

Each shard stores a **specific range** of the total data. For example, with `0/2` and `1/2`, both store 50% of data but on different, non-overlapping ranges.

#### How Sharding Works

Consider a scenario with 128 GB total network data and a 100 GB disk:

1. **Initial Setup** (`shard_position = "0/2"`):
   - Your node stores 64 GB (50% of 128 GB)
   - Stores a specific, deterministic data range
   - Fits comfortably on your 100 GB disk

2. **Network Growth** (total data becomes 256 GB):
   - Your node would be responsible for 128 GB (50% of 256 GB)
   - This exceeds your 100 GB disk capacity
   - **Automatic adjustment**: Node automatically splits to `x/4`
   - Now stores 64 GB (25% of 256 GB)
   - `shard_id` changes: `0` → `0 or 2`, `1` → `1 or 3` (randomly assigned by the node, you cannot control which)

#### Automatic Shard Division

When network data exceeds your disk capacity, the node automatically:
- Doubles the shard number (2 → 4 → 8 → 16, etc.)
- Randomly reassigns to a new shard within the split (you cannot control which)
- Maintains storage within disk limits

:::warning Important Notes
- **Initial setup is deterministic**: When you first configure `shard_position`, the shard_id deterministically maps to a specific data range
- This setting only applies on **first startup** if no shard config exists in the database
- **Auto-splitting is NOT deterministic**: When the node automatically splits shards due to capacity limits, you cannot control which new shard_id you get - it's randomly assigned
- Once shard config is stored in the database, the node manages all future shard adjustments automatically
:::

#### Choosing Your Shard Configuration

To determine the right shard configuration:

1. **Estimate network data size**: Check current total data on the network
2. **Consider disk capacity**: Leave headroom for growth (e.g., use 70-80% of disk)
3. **Calculate shard number**: `shard_number = total_data / (disk_capacity * 0.75)`
4. **Round up to nearest power of 2**: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.

**Example**:
- Network data: 500 GB
- Your disk: 200 GB
- Safe storage: 150 GB (75% of disk)
- Calculation: 500 / 150 ≈ 3.33 → Round up to 4
- Configuration: `shard_position = "0/4"` (stores ~125 GB)

### Running the Node

1. Check configuration options:
```bash
../target/release/zgs_node -h
```

2. Run the testnet storage service:
```bash
cd run
../target/release/zgs_node --config config.toml --miner-key <your_private_key>
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">

### Configuration

1. Copy the mainnet configuration:

```bash
cd run
cp config-mainnet-turbo.toml config.toml
```

2. Update the following fields in `config.toml`:

```toml
# Contract addresses for mainnet
log_contract_address = "0x62D4144dB0F0a6fBBaeb6296c785C71B3D57C526" # Flow contract
mine_contract_address = "0xCd01c5Cd953971CE4C2c9bFb95610236a7F414fe" # Mine contract
reward_contract_address = "0x457aC76B58ffcDc118AABD6DbC63ff9072880870" # Reward contract

# Mainnet RPC endpoint
blockchain_rpc_endpoint = "https://evmrpc.0g.ai"

# Start sync block number for mainnet
log_sync_start_block_number = 2387557

# Your private key for mining (64 chars, no '0x' prefix)
miner_key = "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

3. The mainnet configuration includes predefined boot nodes for network connectivity:

```toml
network_boot_nodes = ["/ip4/34.66.131.173/udp/1234/p2p/16Uiu2HAmG81UgZ1JJLx9T2HqELgJNP36ChHzYkCdA9HdxvAbb5jQ","/ip4/34.60.163.4/udp/1234/p2p/16Uiu2HAmL3DoA7e7mbxs7CkeCPtNrAcfJFFtLpJDr2HWuR6QwJ8k","/ip4/34.169.236.186/udp/1234/p2p/16Uiu2HAm489RdhEgZUFmNTR4jdLEE4HjrvwaPCkEpSYSgvqi1CbR","/ip4/34.71.110.60/udp/1234/p2p/16Uiu2HAmBfGfbLNRegcqihiuXhgSXWNpgiGm6EwW2SYexfPUNUHQ"]

## Snapshot 
Make sure to only include `flow_db` and delete `data_db` under `db` folder when you use a snapshot from a 3rd party !
> Using others' `data_db` will make the node mine for others!

**Additional Notes**
*   **Security:** Keep your private key (`miner_key`) safe and secure. Anyone with access to it can control your node and potentially claim your mining rewards.

*   **Network Connectivity:** Ensure your node has a stable internet connection and that the necessary ports are open for communication with other nodes.

*   **Monitoring:** Monitor your node's logs and resource usage to ensure it's running smoothly.

*   **Updates:** Stay informed about updates to the 0G storage node software and follow the project's documentation for any changes in the setup process.

**Remember:** Running a storage node is a valuable contribution to the 0G network. You'll be helping to maintain its decentralization and robustness while earning rewards for your efforts.
