# How to Get 0G Token

:::tip Interactive Guide
Prefer a guided path? **[get.0g.ai](https://get.0g.ai)** is the official interactive guide to acquiring $0G — pick your starting point (fiat, another chain, an exchange, DeFi, or a wallet) and it walks you through step by step.

## Centralized Exchanges

The most straightforward way to acquire $0G is through centralized exchanges. After purchasing, withdraw directly to the **0G Mainnet** (select "0G Chain" or "0G Mainnet" as the withdrawal network). All exchanges below support withdrawals to the native 0G network — always confirm the withdrawal network in-app before transferring, as availability can be paused during network upgrades.
